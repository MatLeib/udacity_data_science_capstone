## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You will need the standard data science libraries found in the Anaconda distribution of Python.<br>
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.<br>

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany is analyzed, comparing it against demographics information for the general population.

The project is divided into four parts:

### Part 0: Get to Know the Data
Exploring and pre-processing data.

### Part 1: Customer Segmentation Report
Applying unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. 

### Part 2: Supervised Learning Model
Applying supervised learning on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.

### Part 3: Kaggle Competition
Testing the model of Part 2 in a Kaggle competition. Therefore predictions of test data are stored in a CSV file and uploaded on the Kaggle Website.
